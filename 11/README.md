## Data storage in PHP
 - PHP's own format, easy to serialize (with `serialize` function)
 - JSON for general-purpose data that conforms the JSON standard
 - Serialize should be used when data storage is not enough, and we would like to keep the metadata (like classnames in an OOP-style code)
 - We'll use JSON
